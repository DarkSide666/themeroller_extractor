This addon helps you convert jQuery UI Themeroller settings into a LESS
compatible include file.

We hope that Themeroller will start using LESS in the future, but for
now it simply generates a CSS file. When we want to add additional
styles in CSS, we often need to rely on same colors as defined in
themeroller. Currently we must manually find and copy-paste colors. 

By using this simple convertor, it's possible to easily convert URL into
LESS include file and then re-use in your custom LESS framework.
